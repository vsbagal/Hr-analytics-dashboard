# HR-analytics-dashboard
Using this dashboard, I was able to understand the employee attriation rate in the company. Using the different parmeters like years in company, education field, gendre and many more, I have analyzed the given sample dataset of company. Dshboard returns the some key understandings too, as like most of the employees were leave company within first 2 years. Hr can interact with employees and try to understand the problem why should they are leaving the organization within short span years.
It might be because of work culture in company, perks given to the employees or other resons too. Understanding such problems can help company to reduce the attriation rate and improove productivity rate of employees which will helps to contribute in more growth. Also employees stayinmg in the organization more than five years have to get rewarded so as they feel more happy with their work such kind of activities also help organiztion to build healty workcultur for long.
